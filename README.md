# doom-two-tone-themes

A sophisticated collection of two-tone themes for Doom Emacs, each following a carefully crafted color philosophy: **two main complementary colors for syntax highlighting** plus **one accent color for strings and comments**.

## Philosophy

Each theme in this collection is built around the principle of visual harmony through constraint. By limiting the palette to two primary colors plus one accent, these themes achieve:

- **Visual coherence** - Everything feels unified and intentional
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Less visual noise means better focus
- **Professional esthetics** - Sophisticated color relationships
- **Enhanced readability** - Careful contrast ratios for long coding sessions

## Philosophy Behind the Design

These themes are inspired by the principle that **constraint breeds creativity**. By limiting each theme to just two main colors plus one accent:

1. **Every color choice is intentional** - No random or arbitrary colors
2. **Visual hierarchy is clear** - Important elements stand out naturally  
3. **Cognitive load is reduced** - Your brain can focus on code, not colors
4. **Aesthetic coherence emerges** - Everything feels unified and professional

Each theme tells a visual story through its color relationships, whether it's the nautical inspiration of navy-copper or the pop-art energy of pink-sunshine.

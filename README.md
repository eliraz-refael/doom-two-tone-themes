# doom-two-tone-themes

A sophisticated collection of two-tone themes for **Doom Emacs**, each following a carefully crafted color philosophy: **two main complementary colors for syntax highlighting** plus **one accent color for strings and comments**.

> **Note**: These themes are specifically designed and tested for Doom Emacs. While they may work with vanilla Emacs, they have not been thoroughly tested outside of the Doom Emacs environment.

## Philosophy

Each theme in this collection is built around the principle of visual harmony through constraint. By limiting the palette to two primary colors plus one accent, these themes achieve:

- **Visual coherence** - Everything feels unified and intentional
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Less visual noise means better focus
- **Professional aesthetics** - Sophisticated color relationships
- **Enhanced readability** - Careful contrast ratios for long coding sessions

## Collection Status

**Current**: 12 themes (6 dark + 6 light)  
**Planned**: 8 additional themes coming soon for a total of 20 sophisticated two-tone themes!
